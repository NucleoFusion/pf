    Since I started my Computer Science journey, I'd always wanted to manage and
    have a server, where I could host all sorts of stuff, and deploy different
    services that ease my daily online life, such as adblocker.
    <br /><br />
    At the start of June 2025, I finally got the chance to start my homelab journey,
    from reading/seeing people online work on their machines doing all sort of stuff,
    I was very excited to get started and understand the world of Computers even
    more.

    Neovim is something that changed the way I write code, although at the start
    it was something that slowed me down tremendously, repeatedly looking at
    docs to find out how to save, how to quit etc. But now, it has become a part
    of my flow, And this is despite me only scratching the surface of its
    capabilities. <br /><br /> I began to use AstroNvim and building upon that,
    instead of a config from scratch, And with just a minimal config Ive found
    myself going atleast twice as fast since I dont have to reach for the mouse
    at all. Simple keybinds for Complex stuff, which other editors either dont
    have, or are locked behind a complex keybind
    <br /><br />
    Yes, that is an image from when I was writing this page.

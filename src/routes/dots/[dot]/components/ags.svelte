    I have always felt that desktops are bloated and the designs for each are
    very shallow. AGS changes the game, It allows me to use GTK (GUI Library for
    Linux) with JSX/TSX. With reactive bindings for popular components such as
    Battery, Workspaces, Audio, Wifi etc. Allowing me to create lightweight
    desktop layout on my own terms.
    <br /><br />
    AGS/Astal are very versatile allowing users to not just stop at layouts, I can
    build App Launchers, Notification Popups etc. Currently I have plans for expanding
    my config more as soon as v3 of astal rolls out.

    When I switched to Linux a while back from windows. I had finally realized
    the shackles Windows had put on me, and I often describe that, Windows was
    nice, but it always felt like it was not <span class="italic">my</span>
    machine, I was just following what windows allowed me to do, and just deal with
    whatever it wont let me. <br /><br />
    Thus the switch to Arch Linux, Although done to have a better developer experience,
    and practice for eventual Server setup. Was an eye-opener, the sheer amount of
    things I could do and the amount of control I had was fascinating. I can see
    how a non-developer or someone who doesnt like computers all that much would
    prefer windows, as everything in Linux is upto the user.
    <br /><br />
    Experiencing this level of control was something that inspired me to push the
    boundaries of what I could, and that led to my journey in the ever so increasing
    and beautiful ricing community.
